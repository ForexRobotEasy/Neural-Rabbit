## How It Works

Neural Rabbit uses a neural network implementation to perform analysis on different symbols and timeframes. The software follows the following steps:

1. Retrieve data from different timeframes for the specified symbols.
2. Get price variations and indicator values.
3. Normalize the data using the MACD indicator.
4. Perform analysis using the normalized data (TODO: Add your analysis code here).

Once the analysis is performed, Neural Rabbit executes trading functions based on the results:

1. Open a trade based on the neural network analysis.
2. Calculate the trade volume.
3. Implement risk management strategies.
4. Set stop loss and take profit orders.
5. Monitor and adjust trades in real-time based on market conditions.
6. Close the trade.
7. Track and record trade performance.
